## JsHint
http://www.jshint.com/

Online static analysis tool for JavaScript. Its a good idea to get familiar with the option checkboxes -- particularly "Assume browser" and "Assume jQuery". Try running a new script/function in this tool and see what results you get!

She has great talks on CSS. Focuses on simplicity and making CSS truly reusable. The video above talks about how easy it is for CSS to explode. She gives some great metrics by which to judge your CSS.

## Regexr
http://gskinner.com/RegExr/

Regular expression tester. Both a web and desktop client.
Uses ActionScript's flavor of RegExp so it is very similar (and helpful) for JavaScript -- although a few more advanced features are not present.In any case, if you need to build and test an expression this can be very helpful.

## Rubular

Provided by Greg from the Highgroove training sessions. Similar Regexr, but runs in the Ruby engine. Again, really useful for testing expressions and replacements quickly and visually.
