# TTM Memes

If your coworkers are talking about something that doesn't make any sense, the explanation might be here.

* mathbot - the TTM [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot). [Pull requests accepted](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/mathbot)
* Merkeling - The unwanted backrub of a co-worker. Term coined after [this scene](http://www.theweeklymeat.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/12/17/bush_merkel.jpg) of former President George W Bush's touching of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
* Banana runts - The worst candy. Other opinions are invalid.
* Murder Room - In the old TTM office the basement has an old walk-in safe from when it was a department store. The room has a single folding chair and light dangling from a socket. It looks like a place you would go to kill somebody. Photos:

* The TTM Rules:
  1.  No Merkeling - see above
  2.  No Snapchat - It's probably for the best.
  3.  No slave jokes - also probably for the best
* \o/ and/or quinoa - Returns 'I pooped today'. This is from a shirt that was in the display window of the Army Surplus Store next to our old office
* (mancedit) - In hipchat returns a picture of Zack Mance - former Summa consultant with us and Friend Of The Show. Has problems with spelling, so if you misspell something, you have "manced it".
* Innnncredible - One of Zack's catchphrases. Mathbot used to return a picture of Zack on a slide with ice cream when this is used
* Paul Scarrone's Huggin' Pole - One of the pillars from the old office. Surprisingly comfortable.
* Any reference to Jewish/Gentile coffee - Tim's nespresso pods took many weeks to get here because they came from Israel.
* Dumbledore v. Gandalf - Careful which side you take. You will make enemies.
* Derphat - Pronounced _derp-hat_. Joe was our old custodian guy. He wore a hat that said 'Deep', but one day when it was wrinkled, it read 'Derp'
* Derphat - Pronounced _der-fought. Our night-time Turkish systems administrator.  Coined after André was not familiar with the above meme.
* Bwoken - A whiteboard we had shipped to the office arrived with a hole in it. It stayed in the hallway for months. Every couple of days someone would check to see if it had been replaced. Finally Carol wrote in marker on the box, "Still Bwoken" to remind people not to bother checking.
* Seemingly random accents - Tim Bickerton is a trained improv performer, so occasionally he drops into character when talking to people on the team.
* (dollar) - TTM keeps a cookie jar filled with money. Whenever someone violates one of the TTM rules or uses other questionably appropriate terminology in the office, honor demands they add a dollar to the jar. Money may be used to replenish office candy/coffee supplies, or to purchase NES cartridges.
* #TTMDevs - the official unofficial hashtag for the team on twitter. Tweets to this hashtag will, amusingly, automatically be displayed on Jeff Koenig's watch.
* Ghostbusters - some unknown movie about Christmas.
* 1024x768 is the best resolution - one of our projectors at the old office had trouble supporting high res monitors and would flash this existentialist message when you connected to it.
* top shelf - When eStaff, our recruiters, found a really good candidate, they would say the person was "top shelf". Jeff Koenig was the first to be given this designation.
* garbage juice - it can't be explained. Even if you were there. It has something to do with Winters eating a Gremlin and [this](http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/uploads/2010/09/liver-juice-fast.jpg) stock photo
* Winters - Clearly the best wizard.
* "carol me" -
```
[4:48 PM] Steve Robbibaro: does Carol frequently write that way? just looking for the backstory there
[4:49 PM] Jim Wrubel: yeah - there's a back story
[4:49 PM] justin |◕‿◕|: it's not on the wiki?
[4:49 PM] Jim Wrubel: I can't remember the specifics but we were having trouble with our new AWS env
[4:49 PM] mario signore: so
[4:50 PM] Jim Wrubel: @André kept referring to some sort of processor
[4:50 PM] justin |◕‿◕|: I'm adding this verbatim, including interuptions
[4:50 PM] mario signore: meta backstory: andre's naming scheme is not the best
[4:50 PM] Joel McCracken: she used to
[4:50 PM] Jim Wrubel: which isn't a term that we have in the infrastructure
[4:50 PM] mario signore: he has files on his computer that are like x.rb xx.rb z.rb
[4:50 PM] Joel McCracken: seems like she stopped since we added the carol me bot
[4:50 PM] mario signore: anyway, keeping that in mind
		carol was going through the files he made for aws trying to figure out the problem
		and she kept saying "what is a reports processor"
		and after like the third time asking with no response she said
[4:51 PM] Jim Wrubel: carol asked a few times what he meant, and then asked with periods inbetween words
[4:51 PM] mario signore: WHAT. IS. A. REPORTS. PROCESSOR.
[4:51 PM] Jim Wrubel: yeah - what @mario said
[4:51 PM] mario signore: and tim had a field day with it
		so it became a thing
		thus concludes this session
```
* karma - mathbot can give karma to users or arbitrary things by saying ```mathbot karma {thing_with_underscores_if_multiple_words} ++``` and the thing you want to give karma to (```--``` can take karma away). The only rule is Nickelback has to have the lowest karma.
* castle or (castle) - A problem which keeps coming up.  The metaphor refers to a castle in a goldfish bowl; the goldfish circles around the bowl and sees the castle over and over again.
* Monads - Monads are a way of separating impure (e.g., stateful or side-effect-producing) code in Haskell programs, and have a funny name.  It has become a standard response when Bill (or others) mentions Haskell, or anything too academic or nerdy.
* ```--with-no-diapers```: During a late afternoon image binge, Steve Robbibaro asked mathbot for an image of "capcom party" and was gifted [this](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/010/3/a/capcom_party__by_ad_sd_chibigirl-d5r26z9.png). Someone then remarked that he should have used the ```--with-no-diapers``` flag. We are now all aware that when you use mathbot's image lookup functions, occasionally (and when you least want it) mathbot will return an image of a person, fictional entity, video game character, pet, or other living thing in a diaper. Pass ```--with-no-diapers``` to the ```image me``` request to prevent this, or post ```--with-diapers``` as a "what if" addition to another TTMer's previous search.
* width - There was a day or two that Hipchat broke the (thumbsup) and (thumbsdown) emoji so that those got replaced with raw HTML that looked like `(thumbsup)' alt='(thumbsup)' height='16' width='16' src='https://dujrsrsgsd3nh.cloudfront.net/img/emoticons/thumbs_up.png …' />`. Instead of saying (thumbsup) then, we started entering "height width 16" instead. This eventually got shortened to just "width" for (thumbsup) and "height" for (thumbsdown).
* *You're a quiet girl* and/or **STOP FAILING LESSONS** - The TTM app has an activity feed for our customer teachers. They see an entry whenever a student completes a lesson and may give a star or comment on it, and the student receives a notice that the teacher has made a comment or given them a star. At one point we reviewed the comments anonymously to see what types of things were being written. *You're a quiet girl* and **STOP FAILING LESSONS** were two of the funniest comments we saw. Today, you can use `mathbot motivate me` to return five random motivational comments from the activity feed.
* QA Lizard - Joke Carol reposted from [twitter](https://twitter.com/KevinKulp/status/514506216224346113) "A QA Engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a sfdeljknesv..." So Abby brought in a toy lizard that is now hanging about the QA cube to remind us to look for strange edge cases.
* "Bang it out" - The traditional way of ending meetings / standups.  Everyone claps their hands one time, in sync.  It's similar to a football team breaking a huddle.  Greg Funk started this, albeit with one hand upside-down - a variation which has been removed in modern times.
* Million Monkeys problem - [Stafford Brooke](https://github.com/srbiv), one of our contractors from Highgroove, [added a picture of himself for use in tests that upload images](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/apangea/commit/a2921765422bbcbc438b409fe23d2ebbdde8f33d#diff-a9342f5d77e3cef4291e170d106e6d38). [Keith changed this to be a picture of a monkey](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/apangea/commit/324c57266b76b45c2f3f97b03b86e716dfa14ed4#diff-a9342f5d77e3cef4291e170d106e6d38). At some point, people's hard drives were being filled up with many, many copies of the monkey image because we weren't clearing out the directory that carrierwave uploads files to during tests. [This has been fixed](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/apangea/commit/453c201db26b212e337d396708d914da07a42fb7) and we no longer have the million monkey problem.
* OBE - Overcome/Overtaken By Events. A plan or intention that is no longer valid based on changes to circumstances. Definition [here](http://www.pseudodictionary.com/OBE)
* Edgecases - Programming term for user scenarios that can cause a lot of problems. There's a great audio file of Tim singing this, which you can hear by entering `mathbot edgecases`
* Jeff here - Jeff has an amazing ability to pop up in Hipchat when people are talking about him or a QA-related issue. `mathbot jeff here` will invoke him.
* Jeff/Anthlam confusion - Outside our team, TTM staff have sometimes confused Jeff with Anthlam, and vice versa. `mathbot other jeff here` will invoke Anthlam to help clarify.
* `mathbot work work work` - Just try it. Very funny.
* André reviews pretzels - TTM keeps a supply of snacks in the kitchen, including a variety of snack-sized bags of pretzels. After we noticed André selecting some pretzels and not others, we started asking him for his opinions on the best preztel options. There's a [tumblr](http://andrereviewspretzels.tumblr.com) devoted to recording [André's pretzel reviews](http://andrereviewspretzels.tumblr.com).
* Stuff on Joel - As it turns out, Joel is the best member of the team to secretly photograph with objects placed in perspective above him so it looks like they are resting on him. There is a [tumblr](http://stuffonjoel.tumblr.com) with a log of all of the objects that have been photographed on Joel.

## Outdated TTM content
As the saying goes, you have to kiss some frogs before you find a prince. TTM has created and launched some very strange content in the past. All of these are now retired, but they are part of the company culture and fun to look back on as a reminder of how far we've come.
* [Focus Activities](https://ttm-dev-content.s3.amazonaws.com/historical/math/focus_activities/index.html) These were added to the application to try and offer some direct instruction in a 'fun, engaging format'. Most of them ended up looking like old cartoons from the 50s; a hodgepodge of visual styles with many inappropriate and stereotypical characters. On the page, use the dropdown to select a focus activity to play. Balance that Cheese and Canyon Caper are the most worth the watch. Note that these require Flash to be enabled, and not all of them were every added to the app so some of them don't work or are in pre-production phases.
* [The breakdancer](https://ttm-dev-content.s3.amazonaws.com/historical/math/games/BreakItDown_new.html) - This was someone's bad idea for 'fun, engaging, interactive content'. Needs Flash.
* [Game Show](https://ttm-dev-content.s3.amazonaws.com/historical/math/games/GameShow.html) This was supposed to be a quiz in a 'You Don't Know Jack' format. It's more fun to get the answer wrong. The goat noise will haunt your nightmares.
