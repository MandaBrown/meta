Several of our Item Types in the LMS depend on the ability to evaluate math expressions in order to determine correctness, or to provide specific feedback based on student answers. We use a library called [math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) for this. It supports a [wide range of expressions](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/master/docs/expressions.md) entered in an ASCII syntax. You can also use the math.js library in hipchat - just enter ```mathbot calc 6+6``` or whatever you want to evaluate, and mathbot will return the result.

The author of math.js created a REST wrapper for it (math.js is a node program). We have an instance of this library stood up at http://evaluate.thinkthroughmath.com/. We use this in the Attempters to evaluate student responses synchronously for item types that need it.
