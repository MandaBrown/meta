Google analytics requires people to have named accounts to log in. There's no reason you can't have access to Google Analytics, but if you just need to log in and check browser stats or something you can use the credentials  in LastPass:

* Log in here: (https://www.google.com/analytics/)

If you want your own account to Google Analytics just ask IT or Jim and we can set it up.

We send a custom variable to GA for every session to track the user's role. You can access this variable by navigating to `Audience -> Custom -> Custom Variables`. The default view is to track sessions and unique users over the selected time period, but you can also use this segment as a filter for other reports to see, for example, a breakdown of browsers by role type, or how many users of a specific role have hit a particular page.
