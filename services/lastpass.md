Admin credentials for third-party services we use in the platform and for development operations are kept in LastPass folders. Anyone on the team is entitled to have access, but please note these are admin-level credentials. With great power comes great responsibility, etc.

An existing admin will need to add you to the folders, so sign up for a (free) [LastPass account](https://lastpass.com/) if you don't already have one. To make things simpler it's totally okay to use a personal LastPass account, since we can just un-share the folders with you if you ever leave.

To get access just ask Andr√©, Jim, or send email to (ttm.it@thinkthroughmath.com) and we'll get it set up.
