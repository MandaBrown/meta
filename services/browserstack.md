We have 10 licenses for browserstack for user testing. Since not everyone uses them we don't want to pay for everyone to have one, so typically the visually-focused developers will use them. There's one shared account.

It operates on a reservation basis - please ask mathbot to reserve browserstack in hipchat, and return it when you are done.
