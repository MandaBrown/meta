10% time is a chance for us to research topics or work on things that we otherwise might not get a chance to focus on. The goals of 10% time are:
* To explore a technology that might have some benefit to the team or our platform
* To broaden our personal technical skillset
* To work on a backlog item that otherwise woudn't get roadmap priority

While we benefit individually from this effort, it's important that we honor our team values and share this knowledge with others. We do that in one of two ways:

1) By adding a writeup of our findings as a separate markdown page in the `/tenpercenttime` directory

OR

2) By writing and publishing a blog post on our [devblog](http://devblog.thinkthroughmath.com)

Since many 10% efforts span multiple weeks you may not have something to share every week, but you should be sharing a writeup of every 10% initiative you begin and finish. If your research is valuable outside the TTM team, please post it to our external blog, but if not, post it to the meta repo.
