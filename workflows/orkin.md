# Orkin Workflow

Orkin is our name for bugs and bug fixing. Get it? Hah! Hah!

## Filing an Orkin

If you have found something that needs to be fixed, please create a new issue in [the storyboard repo](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/storyboard/issues) with the following information:

* the Orkin milestone
* A priority label (one of the ones starting with `P-`) if you have a sense of how important this is, if not you may leave this blank
* A description that includes relevant environment information (browser, OS, device, time of day, load, etc), steps to reproduce, what happened, and what you expected to happen instead. Enough information so that anyone could look at this orkin and start working on it.

If the problem is with a feature that is currently under development, please make the team working on it aware of the issue so that they can decide if it should be moved to their backlog or not. If the problem is particularly urgent or you are unsure, make someone else aware of the issue.

### PPQ

In relation to orkins, you may also hear about PPQ, which stands for Priority Process Queue. This is where support escalation issues go. Someone, currently Carol, monitors this and triages issues that come in here at least once a day, if not sooner. This person will typically do one of the following:

* Fix the issue immediately if it's affecting students or teachers or is a data integrity issue
* Figure out the cause of the issue and fix the cause if it's small
* Change the PPQ milestone to the Orkin milestone (or another more appropriate milestone) and assign a priority if there are workarounds or the fix is a larger project

If you can fix a PPQ, have relevant technical context or knowledge that is useful to fixing it, or have business priority input, feel free to comment or edit the issue as appropriate even if you aren't the person making sure everything in PPQ gets triagied.

## Orkin Roulette

In order to make sure we're always chipping away at our bug backlog, every few weeks (or more or less often as appropriate), someone (currently Steve) will run a mathbot command that assigns everyone an orkin from the highest priority orkins. When you are assigned an orkin from this process, do your best to fix it when you're blocked or need a break from your main project over the next few weeks. Feel free to ask for help-- this might be an opportunity for you to learn part of the product that you're not as familiar with! If you feel overwhelmed either by the task or by your main project and don't think you'll be able to fix that issue, you can ask anyone to switch orkins with you. If a few weeks go by and you aren't able to fix it for whatever reason, unassign yourself so that it goes back in the pool to be assigned with the next orkin roulette run.
