###Definitions

Use the following to help you understand how to categorize the severity and visibility of an issue.

####Severity

| Severity      | Definition   |
|:------------  |:-------------|
| High          | Application loads, but there is complete failure of application functionality. Core users (students, teachers, administrators) or internal TTM teams are blocked in their ability to perform tasks. No workaround exists. "Students can not do math." |
| Medium        | Impaired application functionality. Diminishes, but does not prevent, the ability of core users (students, teachers, administrators, internal TTM teams) to perform their tasks. A workaround exists. "Students can do math, but not fluidly, elegantly or without interruption." |
| Low           | Cosmetic/design issue, minor annoyance or non-conformance to a standard. Core users (students, teachers, administrators, internal TTM teams) are not prevented or impaired in their ability to perform tasks in any way. |

####Visibility

| Severity      | Definition   |
|:------------  |:-------------|
| High          | Issue occurs 100% of the time. Every attempt to reproduce will result in seeing the issue. |
| Medium        | Issue occurs ~50% of the time. One out of every two attempts to reproduce will result in seeing the issue. |
| Low           | Issue occurs rarely, unreliably or too infrequently to measure. |
