## Quick Process Overview

The best way to contribute to the Engineering process and design projects, is to look ahead on the product roadmap and then decide what kind of information you’ll need to contribute to each feature on the roadmap. Start with which ones are coming up first and try to get as much research about what users want from that feature as well as what the best practices are regarding features of those types. You’ll want to think about what you want to know, and go out and ask those questions in a survey or interview, or figure out if we already know those answers in some way. You could already have data from past surveys or interviews, or there culd  be information you know from talking to stakeholders like ICs, Customer Service or teachers.

Additionally, background research on best practices should come into play and then you can apply what you know about the users through your research to the best practices. Presenting this information to the team and stakeholders ensures that you’re having constructive conversations about requirements, specifications and design. 

The best way to make sure you’re not spinning your wheels is to get everyone on the same page about what the goals are and how they should be met, in order to create a framework to evaluate design decisions as they come up.

Present research to the team at the start of the project in a way that shows the following:
* User Needs (Survey Data, Interview Responses, User Testing)
* Company Goals
* Best Practices (Background Research)
* User Characteristics

Additionally, some collaboration was happening on the Storyboard repo for specific deliverables, but this wasn't really ideal.

### Other Tools of Note

* [Invision](http://invisionapp.com "Invision App") creates click-through prototypes from mocks, as well as collaborate and leave notes on designs. Additionally, you can conduct user tests with the mocks without spending dev time to build something
* [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com "Balsamiq Wireframing") creates wireframes really easily. You can upload Pngs of these to Invision to create click through wireframes very easily.
* [Axure](http://axure.com "Axure Prototyping") creates workable prototypes. There are some Axure files in Google Drive.
* Keynote files help store persona data and research files in an easily accessible way.

## Design Files

Design files are located on Google Drive. The file structure is the following (bolded items are used frequently and important. Italicized Items I don’t think I ever opened):

* Backlog
* _Demos_
* _design files_
* **Features**
* _Layout_
* **Logos**
* n8s Work
* Product Team Branding
* **PSDs**
  * PSD Style Guides
  * User Guides
* _Transferred from lmanning@thinkthroughmath.com_
* TTM_TechSpecSheet
* **UX Reports**
* _Westfall_

### [Features](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B6bKks88JmyidWJQSkdfUmtUdjg&usp=sharing "Features Folder")

Mocks and Documentation of features, current and past, includes research as well as overview reqs/suggestions for the following current projects

* Bunchball Replacement (This also has the PSDs in it to share with Jeremy)
* District Admin Reporting
* District Admin Standards
* Higher Ed
* Lesson Player Feature Tour

Additionally, past features and features that were once in development or on the product roadmap are in here. These include changes or updates to:

* Custom Pathway Creation
* Printing Certificates
* Set UP/Onboarding
* Struggling/Naughty List
* Help/Support
* Parent Notification
* Persona Library
* Geometry
* New Overview Report

### [Logos](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0BxqZ0ujuda-DRE5nN3ZJWFZoTDQ&usp=sharing "Logos Folder")

Any and all TTM Logo you might need.

### [PSDs](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B6bKks88Jmyid2NDemlXMS1SN0k&usp=sharing "PSDs Folder")

PSDs that created the mocks of features, current and past, except for Bunchball which were shared with Dev in the Features folder. These are sorted by project and should be easy to find whatever is necessary.

#### [PSD Style Guides](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B6bKks88JmyiTzlaMGdoYS1XTW8&usp=sharing "PSD Style Guides Folder")

Of importance in the PSDs folder is the PSD Style Guides. There’s one for Admin/Teacher and Student, which details the basic styles for all of the application. There are some outdated styles in the app, but I was slowly working on replacing them so they adhered to these style guides. Additionally, the Style guides will tell you WHY certain colors are used and what they’re used for, so pay special attention to them.

#### [User Guides](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B5PzpJgtn2NuRXc0NHllUkllcU0&usp=sharing)

These are all the working files for the User Guides that have been uploaded to the Help section. Adam and Megan are the ones who primarily replace them, but they’re all here.

### [UX Reports](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B6bKks88JmyiZlJJeUxjLTRQVWc&usp=sharing "UX Reports Folder")

Any and all research files. Usually organized by project. Important of note are the *Presentations, Surveys, and Usability Tests* folders. Presentations contains compiled research fit for nonUX consumption, including presentations on Personas, Colorblindness, Data Visualization and Onboarding.

## Research

### Surveys

All surveys are in [SurveyGizmo](http://surveygizmo.com). Ownership of the account is ux@thinkthroughmath.com and Carl wants to go through the LastPass reqs for sharing passwords and he can get access to anyone.

There are 2 “teams” in SurveyGizmo. One is UX and one is Marketing and those surveys are not for us. The surveys in the UX folder are all UX surveys. Reports have been generated for all the surveys, but if you need specific reports on specific answers, the Reporting function is pretty easy to figure out. If you want to access one I’ve already ran, click on the survey, and then Reports. I’ve titled them all descriptively so you should be able to access them.

In general, the surveys are good for understanding a broad section of who are users are and what they want out of the app. For last school year, the surveys focused on Onboarding, Reporting, and Classroom management. 

### Personas

Personas are located in the UX Reports > [Personas](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/folderview?id=0B6bKks88JmyiSW9pdXQzb2VJVjg&usp=sharing "Personas Folder") folder on Google Drive. We have personas for Students, Admins and Teachers with varying degree of detail. I was in the process of creating a persona library during 10% time, but I was only able to work on it for 2 10% time sessions. For now, all updated information on Personas is in this folder, and a company-facing Presentation on personas is in the Presentations folder for UX Research.

### User Tests & Interviews
User Tests and Interviews are all located in the UX Research folder on Google Drive. If you ever want to user test or interview someone, you can find a list of candidates in Survey Gizmo. In each survey, we ask if they’d be willing to user test. You can export a CSV of all users who responded “Yes” to this question.

I had started some ongoing User Interviews about Onboarding as well as managing classrooms and School Admins who are actually Teachers. Those are all located in this folder.

**As a piece of advice, it’s easier to reward interviewees/testees with Amazon giftcards. We tried TTM products but shipping was RIDICULOUS and it was often cheaper to give them a $10 giftcard rather than swag.

#### Advice on recruiting users:

* If you want five users, email 15. 
* Check out their survey responses ahead of time. Make sure the users you’re testing have used the feature before (if that’s what you’re interviewing about).
* Get a mix of elementary and secondary ed. They have different concerns and experiences.
* Create a calendar spreadsheet for the next two weeks.
* When emailing users, give them 3 suggested dates and times. Vary these to be in morning, afternoon and evening. SPECIFY TIME ZONE. If they are in a different time zone than you, specify their time zone and then YOURS in parantheses. Ex. Monday 3:00 PM CST (4:00 EST)
* Don’t email two users the same time. Block off in light colors which dates you emailed to which user to keep track. Once one of them accepts, block it off in a dark color and delete the other light colors so you can book them again.
* Back to back tests are rough. Try to spread them out.
* Allot 15 minutes MORE than you think you’ll need.
* Set up a Go-To-Meeting ahead of time.
* Email the users the day before their user test with the Go-To-Meeting. Email them again an hour before their test to remind them.

We used the [Rainbow Spreadsheet](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/11/rainbow-spreadsheet-collaborative-ux-research-tool/ "Smashing Magazine on Rainbow Spreadsheet") in order to record observations in one place per test/interview.

### Additional Research Sources

[Design for Kids](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/design-for-kids/) is a really excellent book that provides a lot of good insights with the research to back it up on designing digital experiences for different age groups. 

[UX Team of One](https://drive.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/file/d/0B5PzpJgtn2NuWVBVMkJKYW9kSnM/view?usp=sharing "UX Team of One PDF") is a really excellent book (PDF at the link) that focuses on integrating UX into an organization as well as provides an introduction about how and what to do for UX.
