# Working Remotely at TTM

At Think Through Math we try to balance two sometimes competing perspectives:

1. We should be able to be effective at software development and operations
support regardless of location
1. Much TTM's product development process happens in the Pittsburgh office,
including interactions with stakeholders, content and support. It is not always
possible or ideal to use an all-remote work model for some product development
functions

## Striking a balance
As with other areas where the development model does not integrate perfectly
with the rest of the company, we will seek to manage processes that work for
us in areas we control, and influence processes where we cannot. The following
should be considered best practices and always be followed:
* Wherever possible, use an asynchronous process and/or tool for communication.
Some examples of this are Hipchat and GitHub issues. If a product conversation
can be effectively held in one of those forums, it should be so that it can
be accessed by all team members and is preserved for later reference.
* There are plenty of cases where a face to face meeting or quick chat will be
faster to get to a resolution, or will come to a better conclusion. And sometimes
face to face meetings are impromptu. We don't want to stifle that creative energy; we just need to ensure that when it happens we make sure that people who were
not part of the conversation for whatever reason get caught up.

## Rules for working remotely

Remember that working from home is not a 'sanctioned' benefit. It's a tacit
agreement; we give everyone on the team the flexibility to take time out of the
day to take care of tasks, we just ask that people stay productive with their
time. Productivity is a subjective term and we don't use any artificial measurements
to assess it - it's a judgement call by your manager and can be withdrawn at
any point (but will not be unreasonably withdrawn).

If you are going to work from home for a full or partial day you should:
* Update your calendar to mark your time as Working elsewhere (IT can show you
  how to do this)
* Post notice in the Announcements Hipchat room. We understand things crop up but out of consideration
for your team members and the project managers who may need to be able to track you down,
please try to give advance notice of an upcoming WFH day
* If you are not feeling well, take the day off vs. working from home. Better
to take a short amount of time and feel better vs. being partially productive
but potentially lengthening an absence. This too is a judgement call and depends on
the type of illness you have.
* Make sure your team knows, specifically the project manager, initiative leads,
and anyone you were planning to pair with that day
* Do not schedule WFH on top of scheduled meetings if it can be avoided, especially
if an external stakeholder is involved. It can be difficult to set up a remote
connection at the last minute.
* Try to schedule appointments at the beginning and end of the day vs just WFH if
possible.
* Some people have set up regular days they work from home. This is okay to do,
but please try not to shift this day around a lot.

Team members who are full-time remote don't need to follow these rules, but if
you plan to be away during the day it's always helpful to let the team know.

## Rules for meetings that include a remote participant

If you've ever been a remote participant in a meeting, especially in the TTM main
conference room, you know how hard it can be to contribute. We will continue to
work on improving the technology so that it is not as much of a barrier, but
the following are rules we should try to respect in order to provide all participants
the opportunity to contribute:
* Be sure to allow a few minutes to ensure the remote communication is working
properly before the meeting starts. This is especially important for meetings
with a larger audience
* Please be respectful of remote participants and the slight delay caused by
audio latency. Be courteous if you find yourself speaking at the same time
as another person, especially remote.
* Tie goes to the remote participant when deciding who speaks first
* Raising a hand to speak is encouraged but not required (but may be required if
we feel we need more formal process)
* Meeting moderators should keep track of remote participants and act as their
local advocate where possible
* Please designate a person to keep track of meeting summary and message outcomes
to all participants

### Guidelines for meetings that would be all remote vs local

Where possible we will defer to the _color_ team to decide how to run their
standups - local with remote option or fully-remote. To encourage as much
energy and participation as possible we will always hold interviews, interview
presentations, retrospectives, and requirements gathering sessions that include
stakeholders or TTM staff outside our group as local meetings, but include a
remote option when there are remote participants.

### Facilitating meetings with remote participants
It's the responsibility of the meeting facilitator to ensure that all participants
can, well, participate as much as possible. The meeting facilitator should:
* Set up remote communications (GTM or similar) and test them before the meeting
if needed
* Manage the screensharing aspect and switch presenters if needed
* Prior to the meeting, designate a 'second'. This person will be a local advocate
for the remote participants and in charge of proxying their needs to the group.
This allows the facilitator to focus on the local participants. Because facilitating
a meeting can be a very significant effort, it's likely that the facilitator and
second may not be able to contribute as much to the meeting as other members.
This is a drawback of holding one of those roles, but the benefit to the group
for having a facilitator and second is significant.
