## Tips for giving a good sprint demo

Sprint demos are our team's opportunity to demonstrate progress to the rest of the company, answer
questions about new features, and solicit feedback to improve the product. Giving a clear
demo is an important part of that process. Here are some tips to effectively demonstrate
a new product feature.

- Spend some time preparing for your demo.
  - Practice what you're going to say and walk through the demo at least once prior to the sprint demo.
  - Think about what questions the audience might have and be prepared to answer them.

- Be in the meeting room and on the GoToWebinar 5-10 minutes before the meeting begins.
  - Click the "Telephone" option in the GTW to avoid audio feedback when you are given presenter rights.

- Close Hipchat, Outlook, etc. and/or enter Do Not Disturb mode before demoing.
  - Popups and notifications are very distracting to both you and your audience during the demo.

- If necessary, increase your browser's font size/zoom level to ensure the audience can read small text.

- Before demoing the feature, articulate the business reason that explains why this feature was built.
  - Example: "Currently, users have to BLAH BLAH in order to BLAH BLAH. This is not ideal because of BLAH BLAH. Here's how we made this easier DEMO DEMO."

- Give the demo from a farm instead of your local development environment.
  - Demoing locally is much slower than demoing from a farm. Long pauses between page reloads are
    distracting to the audience and they may perceive the new feature as "slow".

- Don't use identifiable student information during your demo.
  - Using real student data is a FERPA violation. At the very least, change the student names so they are not identifiable.

- Avoid technical jargon.
  - Focus on the end user's experience and not the technical implementation.
  - Avoid using terms like "Apangea", "Data Warehouse", etc. Our users experience TTM as a single product,
    and how they are broken into individual services/applications is not relevant to them.
