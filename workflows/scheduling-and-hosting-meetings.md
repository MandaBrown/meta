## Scheduling Your Meeting

#### Calendar Apps
Since calendaring is handled by our MS Exchange server (probably like 4.0 circa 1993 or whatever), it's best to schedule meetings using the MS Outlook Mac client or [Office 365](http://outlook.thinkthroughmath.com) on the web. You can use your own non-Microsoft calendar app to schedule, but you run the risk of it not playing nice with the Exchange server, and could cause confusion for you and your meeting participants.

##### Using the MS Outlook Mac Client

To add attendees, begin typing in the "To" line or in the "All Attendees" list. Contextual matches will appear for you to select. As you add attendees, you'll be able to see their availability. To add a conference room, begin typing "Think Nation" or "Think Planet" in the "Location" line or in the "Recent Rooms" list, or select a room from the list if any appear. You will always be able to see if a conference room is available, or, if it is taken, who has reserved it.

##### Using Office 365 in Your Browser
###### Default View

The default view to schedule a meeting is ok, but lacks some basic features that enable you to accurately judge availability of attendees and rooms, so I suggest you use the [Scheduling Assistant View](#scheduling-assistant-view).

###### Scheduling Assistant View

To add attendees, begin typing in the "Attendees" list. Contextual matches will appear for you to select. As you add attendees, the number of conflicts will increment if attendees have any, and the conflicts will appear by the attendees in your list. To add a conference room, click "add room." Available rooms will show up with "(free)" next to their names. DO NOT CLICK "Any available room" as it will randomly add any of the free resources, most of which are GoToMeeting (GTM) lines, and NOT rooms.

## Using GoToMeeting

The easiest, and preferred, way to administer and use GoToMeeting (GTM) is to the GoToMeeting Mac app, which you can download [here](https://global.gotomeeting.com/meeting/host). Once the client is downloaded, you can find it in your applications folder. If you plan to use GTM often, I suggest adding it to your dock. Note that once you've installed the app, GTM will automatically install updated versions without deleting old versions. You should occasionally review your applications folder and delete older GTM apps. If you've added GTM to your dock, be sure to update your dock to point to the most recent app in your applications folder. You can do many of the same actions from the GTM website, but I do not recommend using it.

Note that GTM includes a lot of redundancy in the UI. You will find that you can accomplish the same task in multiple places in the app.

#### As a Meeting Attendee

To join a GTM, simply click on the link provided by the organizer. You can also launch the GTM app on your machine, and enter the meeting ID or use the drop down to find a meeting, then click "Join."

#### As a Meeting Organizer

##### Setting GTM Preferences

To organize a GTM, open the GTM app on your Mac. You will need to enter Engineering's GTM account information in Preferences/General.


**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT check the box "Remember me on this computer." If you do, you'll always be logging in under the Engineering GTM account, and will likely be kicking other people off of their GTMs. Mario did this once, and it was rather disruptive to the others on the GTM.

If you like, you can enter a Name and Email Address that you'd like to display to others in the GTM.

##### Starting and Scheduling a GTM

###### Meet Now

To quick-start an unscheduled GTM, click "Meet Now."
**IMPORTANT:** If the GTM is already in use, this feature may not be available OR you may end up "stealing" the GTM from whoever is already using it, so exercise caution.

![GTM Meet Now](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_Meet_Now.png)

###### My Meetings
To browse a list of meetings, click "My Meetings." Click on a meeting, and you have the option to start the meeting, invite others to the meeting, edit the meeting, delete the meeting or schedule a new meeting.

![GTM My Meetings](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_My_Mtngs.png)

###### Schedule Meeting

To schedule a GTM for a future date and time, click "Schedule Meeting." For audio, always select "Use built-in audio conferencing" and "Provide both." This enables participants to call in to the meeting from a phone **or** computer using GTM's conference line numbers.

**IMPORTANT:** A "recurring meeting", despite its name, does not mean a meeting that occurs with at regular intervals. Marking a meeting as recurring means you are reserving the GTM line to be used at _any_ time, not on at a _specific_ date and time. When you check "Recurring meeting", the date and time fields are not editable.

#### Navigating the GTM Interface

So you've started or joined a GTM...now what?

##### Control Panel Toolbar

Note the options on your control panel toolbar may vary depending on whether you're an organizer or simple, run-of-the-mill attendee.

![GTM Control Panel Toolbar](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_CtrlPanel_Coll.png)

##### Screen Sharing

In this panel, you can manage who is presenting and sharing screens. If you're a meeting organizer and would like to share your screen, click "Change Presenter", select yourself, and click "Show My Screen." You will be prompted to confirm and, if you're using multiple monitors or desktops, prompted to confirm which one you'd like to share. You can also grant another attendee screen sharing rights by clicking "Change Presenter" and selecting the attendee. Both you and and the attendee will be prompted to confirm this action.

![GTM Screen Sharing](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_SS.png)

##### Attendees

In this panel, you can see who else is on the GTM and their capabilities. If you're a meeting organizer, tou can also administratively mute or unmute all participants. You can also click "Invite Others" if you'd like to quickly email or copy the meeting information to send to a potential participant. Right clicking on any participant's name provides you more information or additional actions (such as mute) if you're a meeting organizer.

![GTM Attendees](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_Attendees.png)

##### Audio

In this panel, audio input and output can be configured. You're best off leaving these set to "Default." If you're an organizer, you can adjust whether participants are restricted to VOIP ("Mic & Speakers") or have a phone option ("Telephone"). If you're an organizer, the carat in the upper right of the panel allows you to toggle on-hold beeps and entry/exit chimes. You're best off deselecting both (off).

![GTM Audio](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_Audio.png)

##### Webcam

In this panel, you can share your webcam.

![GTM Webcam](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_Webcam.png)

##### Chat

In this panel, you can chat. You can send messages privately to certain individuals or to the entire attendee list. If you're an organizer, you can send messages to other organizers.

![GTM Chat](http://ttm-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/09/GTM_Chat.png)

##### Administrative Options

If you're an organizer, you can limit attendees' ability to chat, see other attendees on the attendee list or share webcams.

## Hosting a Sprint Demo (or large meeting)

Below is how to set up for a sprint demo or large meeting where you need audio, screen sharing and remote attendees and projection all going at the same time, say in Think Planet. In this case, there is already a computer in the room that is connected to the projector in the room.

1. Turn on the projector and ensure the computer in the room is displaying properly on the projector (if necessary).
  * Ensure that the computer's screen saver or power saver settings are disabled.
2. Start the GTM on your computer.
  * You need to be logged in as an organizer for this scenario to work.
3. Select telephone as your audio option.
4. Dial in to the GTM from the polycom in the room.
5. Open the GTM app on the computer connected to the projector (or go to gotomeeting.com) and enter the meeting ID to join the meeting.
  * Ensure that the GTM alert settings are turned off for this computer.
6. If you want to use the webcam in the room to show meeting participants in the conference room, ensure the webcam is connected to the computer in the room and share the webcam from this computer.
7. Manage the GTM presenters from your computer. As you switch presenters, the presenter's screen will show in the conference room, as well as to the remote participants seeing the screen share.
  * If presenters are in the room on their laptops, ensure they are set to telephone as their audio option, and their GTM _and computer_ are both muted.
  * Monitor, or have someone monitor, the chats where remote folks may ask questions.
8. When the meeting is complete, end the GTM, which will disconnect all attendees and the phone.

## Pitfalls

* Wifi
* Lags
* Audio (muting, feedback)
* Computers going to sleep (yours and others)
* Cmd + shift + m (mute)
* Get there early!
* 9 on polycom may not be needed
* Do not move polycom mics
