# Avatar art guidelines

## Category guidelines

Avatar pieces are separated into distinct categories, which follow the following rules:

- Categories are thematically consistent, for ease of use.
- Only one piece can be active per layer, for ease of development.
- Categories exist in a [set order](#category-list), e.g., masks are above eyes, which are above tops.

## Piece guidelines

Each purchasable avatar item is known as a piece. 

- Each piece has a user selectable color, represented in the artwork by a layer named “colorizable”
- Paths and fill areas should be simplified and combined as much as possible, while still being editable, before delivery. Try to balance interest and simplicity of art — there may be performance implications when showing multiple complex svgs in low powered devices.
- Transparency is a great tool to use for shading and effects between layers and over the user-editable color.
- Avoid gradients.
- Essential pieces (eyes, mouth, hair) will likely have 2-4 free pieces for first time users with no spendable points. Suggestions welcome here as well. 

## Content guidelines

- No weapons. Traditionally action or war orientated themes (soldier, knight, mechwarrior) can be portrayed with non-offensive characteristics (camo and helmet,  armor and shield, mech body and mask). Items that have multiple non-lethal uses (e.g., magic wands) are AOK, but should be reviewed before inclusion just to make sure. 
- Avoid emphasizing adult/sexual themes. One or two lipstick and makeup pieces can be included, but focus on non-sexualized, agency-giving make-believe.
- Avoid religious symbolism. Keeping pieces secular will avoid the need for full, equal coverage for an unknown plurality of religions. 
- Provide balanced coverage for all of our demographic groups: genders, ethnic cultures, subcultural interests. Gender and cultural balance are particularly important.

## Category list

Ideally this is the complete list at launch, but categories may be added as the app develops. Categories are arranged in categories from foreground to background. Suggestions for category order, category grouping, and category names welcome as art develops. 

- Foreground accessories 
    - examples: skateboard, foam hands, templar shield, beach ball.

- Friends
    - Little familiars, things with faces. Buddies.
    - examples: cat, dog, dragon, robot, alien.

- Hats and Masks
    - These cover all other face and clothing categories. 
    - Examples: Baseball cap, ninja mask, bandana.

- Coats / overwear
    - Examples: hooded cape, raincoat, armor, robot suits.

- Glasses
- Eyes 
    - Eyes include brows.
- Nose
- Mouth
- Hair 
    - Some ears should ‘poke through’ hair if possible
- Ears 
    - Should be optional. Maybe a single basic ear shape unless a special ear (e.g., gremlin).
    - Examples: earrings, headphones, robot antenna, funny huge ears. 
- Hands 
    - Should be optional, like ears.
    - Examples: gloves, claws.

- Neckwear
    - Could use a better name, suggestions welcome.
    - Examples: Scarf, bandana, necklace, tie.

- Belts
- Tops
    - Examples: shirts, muscles, scales. Full dresses?
- Bottoms 
    - Examples: Pants, Skirts, mermaid tail. Full dresses, that you can put a shirt over?

- Feet and Shoes
    - Boots are a problem here. We would want boots (and other potential covering categories like peg legs and bigfoot feet) to go over pants, but under dresses and coats. Baggy pants wouldn’t fit under boots either. 
    - Options: 
        - Merge pants and shoes into one piece. Least desirable.
        - Put feet and shoes over pants, and allow that some combos (skirts plus cowboy boots) don’t make sense.
        - Put feet and shoes below pants, and allow that some combos (pants plus cowboy boots) don’t make sense.

- Background accessories
    - examples: Wings, mech rockets, tails, umbrella, sun. Environments (moonscape), maybe?
