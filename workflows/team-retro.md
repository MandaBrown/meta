## Summary

We hold a team-oriented retrospective meeting to discuss and share both
positive and challenging experiences with the rest of the engineering team. We
seek to create actionable solutions to these challenges which we can track to
completion.

### Frequency

Presently we hold a retro meeting every 4-6 weeks.

## Preparation

### Retro board setup

We track positive and challenging experiences and track action items in our
Waffle-based retro board as issues or "cards."

Each new retro should have a new milestone created in GitHub's meta repo
indicating the month and year when the meeting will be held (for example:
Retro-2/2016 for the February meeting).  Challenge and positive cards will be
assigned to this milestone from the team prior to the meeting.

Action items are created in the meeting and are always given the milestone of
"retrospective" so that they are shown between all board versions.

### Updating the retro board with new positive and challenging experiences

Once the board is setup, engineering team members can begin to add cards for
challenging and positive experiences for the upcoming retro. As a result, it is
beneficial to create the next retro's milestone early to give people a place to
post ideas when the inspiration strikes.

Team members are also encouraged to "++" comment on any cards that they agree
with or find interesting, since cards with higher discussion counts will be
presented and discussed first the meeting.

### Scheduling the retro meeting

Schedule the meeting through Outlook, booking the large conference room and
giving at least a week's notice.

Schedule a "reminder to retrospect" one day in advance of the meeting. We do
this because the team believes there is value in encouraging ourselves to take
some time--a half hour or so--prior to the meeting to reflect and consider the
past month and update the board accordingly. These posts are our "prompts" for
discussion and are the heart of the meeting.

## Action item tracking

The coming month's retro Waffle board should be presented at the end of stand up
to ensure that progress is being made against tracked action items from previous
retros.

## Setup and hosting the meeting

### Setup

This meeting is considered an in person meeting with remote attendee support.
The entire engineering team is invited, so we hold the meeting in the large
conference room and use the Yeti mic, USB camera, and external speakers with
Goto Meeting for remote support.

For a general overview of hosting a meeting with remote attendee support, see:
[[workflows/scheduling-and-hosting-meetings.md]]

A two computer solution works best for the presentation of the meeting. This
configuration allows us to easily show the remote attendees' web cams, our web
cam, and the retro's Waffle board simultaneously.

Computer #1 should run the Goto Meeting, connect necessary peripherals (Yeti
mic, external speakers, and external camera), and manage the retro's Waffle
board. This computer must be connected to the network through the Thunderbolt
network dongle since the wifi the conference room is hit or miss and this is the
single most important computer in the room for the meeting.

Computer #2 should project its screen in the conference room, which includes
the shared Waffle board from computer #1 and the web cams.

It is easiest if the organizer/host of the meeting uses computer #1 and a
volunteer handles computer #2. This person can also serve as a "remote
presence" who serves our remote attendees by communicating with them over chat
and giving them the floor when it is difficult to break in to the conversation.

### Meeting overview and procedure

#### Action Items review

Start by quickly running through the action items list to ensure that they
still make sense to be tracked through the retro board. Action items can be
tweaked to give them more "actionable" and quantifiable criteria for "done,"
moved to be tacked else where, continued to be tracked here without any change,
or moved to "complete" if finished.

#### Review positive experiences

Walk through cards in the positive experiences category, starting with highest
number of comments to lowest. (It is helpful to sort these in advance to save
time.) Give team members opportunity to speak to each ticket, as well as giving
the floor initially to the author of the ticket to present to the team.

#### Review challenging experiences

Walk through cards in the challenging experiences category, starting with
highest number of comments to lowest. (It is helpful to sort these in advance
to save time.) Give team members opportunity to speak to each ticket, as well
as giving the floor initially to the author of the ticket to present to the
team. Look for team consensus/disagreement and comment on the ticket as
appropriate to document. Drive the conversation toward an actionable goal. Move
the ticket to the action items backlog. Assign one person to be the owner and
responsible for the ticket. Other "owners" should be pinged to draw the
attention to them.
