# Your New Life

Welcome to TTM, we're glad to have you on board. To make things easier, we've made this guide to describe what you'll need to do to get set up and productive.

## Get some accounts

You'll need some accounts. See our [Accounts Needed](accounts-needed.md) page for a full list.

## Get some apps

You're here to code, right? You'll need something to edit.
See the README files for the following apps

[Apangea](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/apangea/blob/rc/README.md)

[Reporting](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/reporting/blob/rc/README.md)

[Lesson-player](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/lesson-player/blob/rc/README.md)

[Live-teaching](https://github.com/thinkthroughmath/live_teaching/blob/rc/README.md)

## Get a tutorial

Even if you're not yet itching to know the life cycle of a story or task, it's a good idea to schedule a demo of our story/task workflows between Planbox, Git and Github. Contact Tim Bickerton or Jeff Koenig to schedule a demo or get started by reading about our [Development Workflow](/workflows/development.md).

## Understand our quirks

Check the [TTM Glossary](/Glossary.md) if you hear a work related term and you're not familiar with it. If it is not there, put it in.

Do you know what (mancedit) is yet? Or why you owe a dollar? Read the [TTM Memes](/misc/memes.md) to understand our quirkiness.

## Settle In

Now that you're setup, there are some things about [Everyday Life at TTM](/onboarding/everyday-life-at-ttm.md) that you may eventually need to know. Like where office supplies are and how to report expenses.
