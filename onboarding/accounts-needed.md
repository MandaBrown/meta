### Email

See John. You'll need a TTM account for the rest of these probably.

### Hipchat

We use Hipchat for group chat and instant messaging. Set this up first after you have an email address. It will give you a nice convenient place to ask questions. You should hang out in Engineering Team Chat, Engineering Off Topic, and your team specific room.

### Scalr

See AndrÃ©.

### Bugsnag

See [this meta page](/services/bugsnag.md)

### Trello

You may already have an account, but if you don't, create one up and let Tim Bickerton know your username.

### Github

You probably already have an account, but we need to add you to our team.


### Skylight

Skylight access can be given by Jim Wrubel, or otherwise accesed via information available in our shared [LastPass](#lastpass) folders

### LastPass

TTM has some folders shared on LastPass for shared accounts for services used in the platform. Information on how to get access is on the [LastPass page](/services/lastpass.md).

### Jenkins

For READ access, all you have to do is login to github, click into the settings for the thinkthroughmath org, then click users, and it should give you an option to make your association with the thinkthroughmath org public.  This should allow must users the access they need to Jenkins.

For ADMIN access, have Jeff add your github username to Jenkins-- Jenkins Homepage -> Manage Jenkins in left hand menu -> Configure Global Security in the center menu -> scroll down to the "Github Authorization Settings" section -> add their github username to "Admin User Names" and save

### Gravatar

Add your thinkthroughmath.com email address to your gravatar profile

### Twitter

Completely optional, but we make a lot of inside jokes on Twitter. If you don't follow along, you may be confused at what the hell we're talking about on a daily basis.
