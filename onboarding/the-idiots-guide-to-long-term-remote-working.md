## Daily Standup Procedure
Currently GoToMeeting is the choice of each of the two teams. In the morning, log into HipChat for the respective room and ask the stand up coordinator for an invite into the hangout.  

## Team Communication Channels
### General Chat
The team uses HipChat for general discussion. There are two rooms. Engineering Team Chat is where you can ask questions, advice, or any other things related to work. Engineering OffTopic is where you can have mathbot pull up pictures of capybaras.  You can also create any other room for breakout teams.

If you don't have a HipChat account, you can get into our organization here https://www.hipchat.com/invite/44708/60627c6ad0d24300254534af2c0b458d 

### One-on-one chat
You can double click on someone in HipChat to send them a personal message that will not be seen by others in a room.

### Pairing & Screen sharing
