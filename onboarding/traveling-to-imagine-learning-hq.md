This page holds some key informtion for people traveling to Imagine Learning headquarters.

## Flights

When flying to Provo you should book air travel to Salt Lake City. SLC is a Delta hub, but of course there's no direct flight because `#Pittsburgh`. Provo is 2 hours behind Pittsburgh (Mountain Time) so if you fly out in the morning you can usually arrive in time for mid-afternoon meetings, if any. But in general, plan on losing a day on each side due to travel.

Provo is actually about 1 hour south of Salt Lake City, so be prepared to rent a car, especially if you are flying by yourself. If you are traveling with a group please only rent one car for the group.

## Hotel

* The [Marriott Provo](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/slcvo-provo-marriott-hotel-and-conference-center/) is the 'host hotel' when traveling to the IL offices. It's located in downtown Provo. It has a restaurant and Fake Starbucks in the lobby.
