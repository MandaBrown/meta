## TTMDevs anti-policies
In the greater engineering team (which includes QA, project management, and operations) we focus on productivity rather than time-in-seat, and we try to give every person the freedom (with some limits, described below) the ability to get tasks completed on a schedule that works best for them. This arrangement requires mutual trust and respect; we offer this flexibility on the condition that you not abuse it. 

## Typical work hours
Although we do not have an official start of the day, we strongly encourage/expect everyone who is working that day to be online and connected in to the team's workflow between 9 and 9:15. Since as a group we value sharing of information and pairing on tasks so that no one is left to implement features by themselves, we need to keep a set of core hours so that we can maximize the time available to coordinate with the teams. Team members located in other time zones have an exception to this policy, but even in this case we seek to maximize the collaborative work time. Our work day typically wraps up between 5 and 5:30 eastern.

### Flex time
We recognize that there are a lot of cases where it is necessary for a team member to take care of some personal errand during work hours. Getting cable/internet installed, doctor's appointments, car service, are all things that can't always easily be taken care of on nights or weekends. Emergency situations such as home/rental crises fall in to this category.

So long as you make up the time over evening or weekend there's no reason to consider things in this category as Paid Time Off. If you know ahead of time that you have an upcoming appointment, an email to #product-development@thinkthroughmath.com is greatly appreciated so we can work around it. If it's an emergency, just drop an @here in Hipchat Eng Team room to let people know you are stepping out.

This policy assumes a significant level of personal responsibility and initiative. Please don't abuse it. There is no objective measure of 'abusing it' and there never will be. Jim will make the determination as to whether any individual is abusing this policy, and it can be cancelled if it is not respected.

### Working from home
As with Flex time, we allow team members to work from home occasionally if personal circumstances arise. Please give 24 hours notice to #product-development if you are working from home. While we have structured our work environment to be neutral to location, we all recognize that there's value in being in the office if you have the ability. This policy, like the flex time policy, is based on trust. It will be withdrawn if abused. Note that occasionally we have VIPs in the office and require everyone working from the office. We will provide ample notice via email on those occasions.

## Paid Time Off/Sick Time
Paid Time Off is generous at TTM. It's used for vacation, personal days, and significant illnesses. As a rule of thumb we prefer to have one week's notice for every day taken, but we understand things creep up, especially illness. Please use the [Paychex PTO tracker](https://myapps.paychex.com/) for submitting PTO requests. If you don't have an account please see Lindsay Seal. Informally, we prefer you save PTO days for vacation and personal time. If you are sick and able to make up the time over the course of a week or so, that's fine. As with all other policies this is subject to cancellation if abused.

## Wrap up
This article is an attempt to describe our TTM anti-policies. As a team we value collaboration and shared knowledge. If you need to be away from the office for any of these reasons it is your co-workers who most need to know that, especially the ones you may be working closely with at the time. Our official corporate policies are far more restrictive than what is described here, and if there is any dispute, the corporate policies take precedence. Everyone on this team is here in part because we believe that motivation for creating great product and software that serves our students comes from within, not because it's dictated externally. Please try to use the flexible work schedules in a manner that supports this belief.
