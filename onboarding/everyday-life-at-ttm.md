# Everyday Life at TTM

This page is intended to provide an orientation to working at TTM. It's not specifically focused on the technical teams but it's valuable information. In the long term we expect TTM to have a company intranet of sorts - when we do this page will just be pointers to the intranet resources.

## Expectations of work schedule

Please see [Flexible Work Scheduling](flexible-work-scheduling.md)

## Expenses

Expenses you want the company to reimburse need to have a form submitted. There's a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj6JiTiQXxg4dGlfa1JGOGpSYTVOdklUaVJ3TXhzbkE&usp=drive_web#gid=0) you can use for this. It's pretty self-explanatory. Finance strongly prefers printouts of the form for signature and you have to attach printed copies of receipts.

As a growth-stage company we some times go through leaner periods, and we may defer or temporarily suspend reimbursable expenses to manage costs. Tim or Jim will announce in Hipchat and email if this is the case. Generally, please get approval for any company expenses before you incur them. This is an informal process and can be an email, chat, or conversation. A few expenses can be reimbursed without up-front approval; these categories are listed below.

### Cell phone expenses
Every member of the team gets a reimbursement of $60 for cell/mobile data plan. Jim or Tim can sign for it. It's up to you to take advantage of this - it's not automatically applied. You don't need pre-approval each month. **Note:** This benefit is not available companywide so please don't blab about it. In order to submit for this you need to fill out an expense report form (from above), and attach a copy of your cell bill (just the top page is fine - no need to share the detail). If the total is more than $40, just claim the $60. If for some reason your bill is lower than $60, you can claim the amount you paid. It's okay if yor cell plan is a family plan with other lines or if it's under someone else's name.

### Comings, goings and milestones
It's appropriate to expense a team lunch, treats, or similar to celebrate key events for the team. Some examples of things that will generally be approved without question are new hires, departures, and postlaunch celebrations for key strategic initiatives. There's no specific guidance on a per-person dollar amount that's appropriate but for a new hire lunch, Rivertowne would be appropriate and Hyde Park steakhouse would not. Tim or Jim can provide guidance if you are not sure about something specific.

### Managers
If you directly manage a team, it's completely appropriate to expense a working lunch once a quarter to discuss career and growth. More frequent lunches aren't out of the question, but please get approval first. Likewise if you manage a remote employee it's fine to expense travel to meet with that person face-to-face on the same schedule.

### Travel expenses
Travel for our team is rare, but does happen occasionally. Typically this would be to a customer site or conference, and would be something that's discussed with your manager, Tim or Jim ahead of time. You are responsible for booking your own travel, including airfare and hotel. Since plane tickets need to be paid for when booked, you can submit that expense as soon as you incur it. All expenses need receipts; we re-imburse for actuals. At their discretion, a manager may approve reimbursement for alcohol as part of a meal while on travel.

### Remote employees
Generally it's fine for a remote employee to plan one trip to the office per month, and to expense all charges for the trip. These charges would follow the same guidelines as the travel expense policy above.

### Conferences
TTM does not currently have any policy for reimbursing conference registrations or travel; these are approved on a one-off basis. We are working to establish a budget per-employee for conference reimbursement, but nothing is in place at this point.

## Office supplies

The cabinets near the live teacher section stock a lot of things. If you need anything special we'll order it. Ask Jim or Tim for help if you need something.

## Purchasing software or other things online

From time to time we may need to purchase software or supplies. Jim or Andr√© have access to the company card. Most purchases are approved without a lot of fuss, but we need to keep track of receipts. Subscriptions to software packages like the Adobe suite are fine, if you need them for your job.

## Need a Latte?

The Nespresso/latte machine is available for use, but ask Tim to train you on it first.
