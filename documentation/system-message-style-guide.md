# Introduction
The following is a guide to writing user-facing copy for all areas of the TTM applications. It will start off with general guidelines about writing user-friendly copy and will get situationally specific as the guide goes on. When in doubt about grammar or punctuation, use the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), or ask someone on the Content Team if you can see their Copyediting Stylesheets.

# Readability
For **Students**, everything should be written at the **lowest possible reading-level**. Read through each sentence more than once and try to find the easiest words to use. Check each word to see if there is a simpler way to say it.

For **Teachers and Admins,** keep all copy **below a 6th-grade reading level**. If it's good enough for the NYTimes, it's too good for us. Keep it simple. 

You can check a readability score for any copy at [Readability](https://readability-score.com/).

# Legibility
**Avoid huge blocks of text.** Write copy so it is easily scanned. Call out important points with bold text but remember that what is important to you is not necessarily important to the user. Highlight the words the user would use and not the words you as a representative of TTM would use.

**Be careful with line length.** It should be no more than 50-75 characters per line. If it goes more than that, you can increase the type size or decrease the width of the text. If it goes less than that, decrease the type size or increase the width of the text.

**Keep copy brief.**

# Grammar Style
**Use the series comma:** one, two, and three; $25, $35, or $45. With long series, use bullet points.

"Let's Eat, Grandma!" and "Let's Eat Grandma!" are two different sentences. Make sure you're using **serial commas** appropriately.

Use commas within four-digit numbers: 2,560.

**Hyphenate simple word fractions** (nouns and adjectives): one-­sixth, one-­half of a 
whole, two­-thirds majority, three­-quarters of an hour, unless either the numerator or denominator already contains a hyphen: Five twenty-­fifths equals one-­fifth; ninety-nine hundredths. In general, simple fractions used as nouns can be open, for example: You can fold one half onto the other half so that the points match up.

**Hyphenate ordinal numbers modifying nouns:** first-­place winner, 123rd-­row seat.

**Omit apostrophes with number plurals:** put the 3s in one pile and the 2s in another.

**Never use an ellipsis.** It's really not necessary in a system.

Use colons and semi-colons sparingly.

When mentioning **time**, always say it's 6 p.m, not 6:00 pm or 6PM. If it's 6:30 p.m., then you can enumerate the minutes.

# Voice Guidelines
The voice of the site should be unchanging. At Think Through Math, we need to be:

* Professional but not stuffy
* Helpful but not patronizing
* Clear
* Simple
* Polite

## Administrators
Keep all copy for administrators professional and neutral. Avoid talking to them directly with "you" statements. 

**Worst example:** "Gee Golly Gee, Joe, that upload just plain didn't work! You can try uploading again with a .png or a .jpg"

**Bad example:** "Oh no, Martha! You uploaded the wrong kind of file! Better luck with a .png or .jpg"

**Also bad:** "Oh no! Think Through Math does not accept that file format. You can try the upload again with the following file formats: .png .jpg"

**Ok Example:** "Think Through Math does not accept that file format. You can try the upload again with the following file formats: .png .jpg"

**Best Example:** "We're sorry, but Think Through Math does not accept that file format. Try using the following file formats: .png .jpg."

##Teachers
You can have a little more fun with teachers if something is directly teacher facing. Try to use the words that they would use. However, since there is so much overlap between Teachers and Administrators, it's best to write for Administrators.

##Students
To reiterate, everything written for students should be at the lowest grade-level possible. Regarding tone, you can keep it light and casual. Most of the copy we have for students is managed by the content team, but when writing an error or success message, it should be informative but not complicated. If the student will need to ask a parent or teacher for help, let them know.

#Tone Guidelines
Tone is slightly different than voice. We always have the same voice but sometimes we need to change our tone depending on who we're talking to and why. It's the same with messaging. When you're writing a message, consider the user's state of mind. Is the user confused? Did they just experience an error? Or are you just trying to help them out with some helpful information?

## Error Message Guidelines
**Never, ever, ever blame the user.** When writing an error message about uploading the wrong spreadsheet, the user isn't wrong; the system is wrong. Ex: Don't say: "You uploaded the wrong file format." Instead, say "We're sorry, but Think Through Math does not accept that file format."

**Give the user a solution to the problem.** Ex. "We're sorry, but Think Through Math does not accept that file format. Try using the following file formats: .png .jpg."

## Tooltip & Microcopy guidelines
**Don't patronize the user.** When you're writing a message regarding educational standards, for example, don't say "State standards are developed by the government as a set of educational benchmarks students should know. We measure student performance on state standards in the Standards Report." Instead, you could just say "We measure student performance on the same state standards your students will be tested on in the Standards Report."

**Don't assume the user knows the same about technology as you do.** While some of our teachers and administrators can be tech savvy, they do not keep as up-to-date with browser technology and the terms we use all the time. When in doubt about technology, explain it. For example, you shouldn't say: "Microsoft products will not render the app the same way as Google will." Instead, "TTM will not always work to the best of its ability on older versions of Internet Explorer, like IE8 or IE9. If you use a browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, TTM should work well."

**Structure copy so it is user-friendly.** It's really, really important to note that our users scan copy. If you're ever writing a long message, the first clause of the sentence should be something the user is looking for. For example, when writing instructions on how to perform a few tasks, you should write "**To perform task A**, click the Next Button. **To perform task B**, click the NotNext Button." You should NOT write "Click the **Next button** to perform Task A. Click the **NotNext Button** to perform Task B." It's too easy for the user to see "Click the Next Button" and just click it, even if they want to perform Task B because it's the first thing they saw.

**All Buttons Must Have an Action.** Since buttons always DO something, they should all describe the action they are doing in a way that makes sense to the user. This is mostly a forward rule since there are a lot of buttons in the system that DO NOT describe an action.
