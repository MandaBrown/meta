alt All good, student has enough points. 
    A->A: Purchase records made; student record \nupdated with owned piece details (color selection\nand whether the piece is being worn).*
    A->AB: Updated points
    AB->AB: Set pieces being worn that\nare not owned yet to owned;\nupdate point info.
else Nope, didn't have enough points. No action was taken.
    A->AB: Actual points
    AB->AB: Reset avatar; update point info. **

Note right of AB
    * This means that students can only store color 
    selections for pieces that they own.

    ** We haven't settled on a UX interaction for this 
    yet, exactly. For MVP, 'reset avatar' means put the
    avatar back into the state it was when it was last
    saved.

    We *could* do other things in the future (in order      
    of difficulty):
    - Keep changes except for purchases (remove 
      'purchased' items from the avatar)
    - Put the avatar builder in a mode where they only
      see purchased items, and have to take them off 
      until they are no longer in the red.

    At this time, we think the most common case where 
    this might happen is if the student is cheating,
    in which case we don't care. We think there are
    edge cases where this isn't true, but they'd be
    extremely rare. We don't think that losing 
    info since the last save is the worst thing in 
    the world, since most of the time spent customizing
    is playing. Actually picking end-state pieces
    and colors once you know what you want is very 
    quick, if a little bit less convenient.
