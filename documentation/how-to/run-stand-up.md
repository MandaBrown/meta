2. Open GoToMeeting
  1. Click "My Meetings"
  - Email Address:  
  - Password: 
  2. Double click on "Daily Engineering Standup" list item.
  3. **Make sure you change the audio on *your* computer  from "Telephone" to "Mic & Speakers"**
  4. **Mute GoToMeeting on your computer, or you will get some nasty feedback when you unmute GoToMeeting on the TV.**

3. Set up GoToMeeting on the TV.
  1. Run `mathbot daily standup` in hipchat.
  2. On the big TV, using the trackpad on the keyboard, click the button to unmute.
  3. Ensure that the the "Yeti Microphone" is plugged in and selected.
  4. Ensure the external speakers are plugged in, turned on, and selected.
  5. (I would advise doing a Yeti test by tapping the microphone).

4. Start Standup!
5. PROFIT!!

**If there are any changes to the tabs please update the list after standup**
