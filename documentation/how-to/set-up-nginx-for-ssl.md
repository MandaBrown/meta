First, update brew and install nginx via brew:

    brew update
    brew install nginx

Build a fake ssl cert and install it (much of this info is taken from [[https://gist.github.com/trcarden/3295935]])

    mkdir /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/
    cd /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/

Let's make a key! Single command all on one line. You should have two files at the end. localhost.key and localhost.crt

     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha1 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=Pennsylvania/L=Pittsburgh/O=SW/CN=localhost" -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt

Back up the original config (just in case)

    cd /usr/local/etc/nginx
    cp nginx.conf nginx.conf.orig

Edit nginx.conf to use ssl termination and passthrough: (This config is from TTM Production with some minor edits)

Per user customization:
* To run on port 80 and 443, change the listen lines under server. If you make this change stat nginx with sudo nginx. Otherwise start without sudo. (Port 80 and 443 are privileged ports.)
* Change paths, search for /Users/andre and update as needed.
* For the lesson player make a symlink in your home directory to the dist folder.
 
            ln -s MY_LESSON_PLAYER_GIT_FOLDER/dist lesson_player

Now add nginx to startup and reload

    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.2.7/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

Then you should be able to go to https://localhost:8443, add a security exception, and go!

If you don't want to add nginx to startup

    Start nginx with `$ nginx`
    Stop nginx with `$ nginx -s stop`
    the `-s` switch allows you to send the stop signal whenever you want
    and use sudo if you configured to run on port 80 and 443
