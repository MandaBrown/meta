# Overview
PSP is the Problem Solving Process and is often referred to as "5 Step" by the team.   
GL is Guided Learning, they have learning coach hints and live help assistance   
Focus is a video that helps students understand concepts   

## Viewing/Testing Problems
There are a few ways to preview activities. Here is the process for a super user:

1. Log in to the admin site as a **super user**
2. Navigate to **"/activity_previews/new"** (most likely you need to manually type this in the URL)
3. Use the select menus to choose a Unit, Lesson, and Activity
4. Click **Preview Activity**.
