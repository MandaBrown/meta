## Reporting Ecosystem

This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/spreadsheets/d/1sm-vZYKS6pXhI6lto2gPOiw6orNc06oUdV9oDUmdF_o/edit#gid=840162159) is a catalog of reports in the system, which roles can access the reports and where, and what fields are in each report.

## Reporting Scenarios

This [document](https://docs.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/document/d/1GJfUZRq_fIBwRa75GTX-vN5TVDUgGLvm14WUZxDifY4/edit) attempts to describe the definitions of some of the fields and terms used in reporting, and some guiding principles for how these are handled in various scenarios along with some concrete examples of how these scenarios would be handled.

This [presentation](https://docs.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/presentation/d/1ZfepC-U4SCtAOM2zbdbBWthc8byJHeOb-7vs2RYRlMs/edit?usp=sharing) highlights what happens specifically when a student is added to another classroom, moved from classroom to classroom, or deactivated.
