# Secret Customer Settings
## or, Where did my settings go?

There has been concern about accidental changes to customer settings that have functional impact, so some customer settings have been moved to a page that can only be accessed by superusers that url hack to the appropriate page. These fields are:

- State
- Flags for: 
  + Demo
  + Hide Common Core
  + Higher Ed
- Regions List
- Promotional Copy

If you need to edit any of these fields, visit

`/customers/1/secret_edit`

(where `1` is the id of the customer that you need to edit).

See thinkthroughmath/storyboard#1561.
