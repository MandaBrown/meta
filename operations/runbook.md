The TTM applications have a Runbook, that describes common operations issues, troubleshooting, debugging, and how-tos for common tasks. The Runbook is a great first place to look for anyone who may be taking lead on troubleshooting a production issue.

The Runbook is hosted on Google Drive, [here](https://docs.google.com/a/thinkthroughmath.com/document/d/1U1uQ-AJYMA_SiLBN8fcY3660qKt2eYFpCNwhk9DDvfA/edit?usp=sharing). Jim, Andr√©, Jeff and seejee have edit access; see one of them if you need to make an update.
